Brainstorm

* 2D, vector art style inspired by PixelJunk Shooter
* Enemy types
	* Drone - constantly moves towards player, speed increases over lifespan, doesn't shoot
	* Hulk - moves randomly, constant speed, very high hitpoints
	* Shooter - tries to avoid player, shoots homing projectiles
	* Factory - tries to avoid player, spawns shooters
	* Mine - static object, destroys player on contact; can be shot
	* Tank - moves randomly, shoots reflective projectiles

* Bullets need to have a trailing "smoke" effect
* Experiment with 8-way shooting instead of total 360 degree
* Powerups
	* Shield - allows player to take an extra hit
	* Rapid Fire - increases firing rate
	* Double Shot - fires two shots at a time
	* Speed Up 
* In-app Purchase
	* Chance for powerups to drop
	* In-game credit doubler
	* Different ship designs/colors
	* Add sockets for stat bonuses?
		* Speed
		* # of guns?
		* Rate of fire
* Level transitions
	* Board reset or dynamic, while the player is still moving around?
